# 4. What Happens to Email After Transfer?

The Archives acquires or makes a copy of your email (and associated attachments) and stores it offline in the `mbox` format.

For SFU email, the Archives uses a tool called [OfflineImap](http://www.offlineimap.org) to download email from the SFU mail server. For email originating in other systems, the donor must be able to provide it already exported to `mbox` or in a format that the Archives can convert to `mbox` (see [Section 3, Non-SFU Accounts](./s3-non-sfu-accounts)).

When a transfer is complete, the Archives accessions the records (assigns a unique `Accession number`) and uploads it to the Archives digital repository using [Archivematica software](https://www.archivematica.org/en/). Here the email remains in "backlog." At a later date, an archivist will process the transfer using [ePADD software](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd) for further appraisal, selection, description, and curation.

When processing is complete, the archivist updates the Archives' online catalog, [SFU AtoM](https://atom.archives.sfu.ca), with a series-level description of the email records in the context of the creator's entire holdings ("fonds").

Access is provided on request and will typically require a [Research Agreement](http://www.sfu.ca/content/dam/sfu/archives/ARMDForms/Research%20Agreement.pdf). The Archives delivers access to the records through a dedicated offline terminal in the Archives' reading room using the [ePADD platform](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/epadd).

For more information, see the more detailed guidelines (generally for SFU Archives' staff) on Email Archiving at SFU Archives (forthcoming).
