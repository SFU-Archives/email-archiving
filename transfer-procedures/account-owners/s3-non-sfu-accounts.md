# 3. Non-SFU Email Accounts

Currently, the Archives can accept non-SFU email if it can be transferred in `mbox` format or in a format that can be converted into `mbox`.

SFU Archives does not currently hold any email archives from non-SFU accounts. Donations of personal correspondence from non-SFU email systems will be handled on a case-by-case basis.

In general: non-SFU email must be transferred in `mbox` format or in a format that can be converted into `mbox`.
- The Archives has a script for converting email from `maildir` to `mbox` formats.
- Gmail can be exported by users themselves as `mbox`; the process is documented below.

Note that the Archives will not normally acquire email in the form of Microsoft `pst` files. Our sense is that `pst` files are typically less complete and the tools for migrating are less robust.

## 3.1 Gmail

Individuals wishing to donate private correspondence from their Gmail account may use Google's "takeout service" to export their own email themselves.

Google's takeout service delivers email in `mbox` format. Export and download your email as `mbox` files, then transfer the file(s) to Archives using the Archives' [standard digital transfer procedure and the SFU MoveIt packager](http://www.sfu.ca/archives/digital-repository/transfer-digital-records.html).

When using Google's takeout service, it is vital that you change the default `All Mail data included` settings.
- Navigate to your Google account page and log in (myaccount.google.com).
- Click the `Data and personalization` link on the sidebar.
- Click the `Download your data` link.
- Navigate to the `Mail` section.
- Click `All Mail data included`.
- In the `Mail contents options` menu, deselect `All Mail` and select the individual mailbox folders (even if you must select all of them).

The last step (deselect `All Mail`) is critical because it ensures that the original folder structure is preserved, i.e. each folder is exported as its own `mbox` file rather than one big `mbox` file for everything.
