# Email transfer procedures for account owners

These procedures are written for owners of email accounts who wish to transfer email to SFU Archives. The Archivesâ€™ transfer methods for email require that account owners perform certain actions on their end. This guide describes these actions and how to do them.

Anyone considering transferring email to the Archives should make sure they understand the implications of transfer; please read [Before you start (section 1)](./s1-before-you-start.md).

For a quick overview of the process, jump to [section 5, Checklist](./s5-checklist.md). For detailed instructions, see [section 2](./s2-sfu-accounts.md) for SFU accounts, [section 3](./s3-non-sfu-accounts.md) for non-SFU accounts.

Those interested in what happens behind the scenes can find a brief description of the process in [Section 4](./s4-after-transfer.md) and (in more detail) in the Archives' general [Guide for email archives](../../guide-email-archives/guide-introduction.md) (in progress).

Note that the email transfer process captures only email messages and attachments. The Archives does not currently acquire other records typically included in email platforms, e.g. calendars, address books, task lists.
