# 1. Before You Start
The Archives is selective in its acquisition of email. Our plan is to develop a more formal acquisition strategy which will set out selection criteria. In the meantime, consult with an archivist to determine whether or not your email can be retained for permanent archival preservation and if so, which parts of it.

In general:
* Emails made or received in your capacity as an SFU employee engaged in university business are university records and may be transferred to the Archives under an applicable [Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority (RRSDA)](http://www.sfu.ca/archives2/dur/rrsdas.html).

* Emails as personal correspondence may be transferred to the Archives under a [Donation Agreement](http://www.sfu.ca/archives/for-donors/donations.html).

An archivist will advise you on how to proceed.

Please be aware of the implications of transferring your email to Archives. It is not a service to provide you with ongoing access to your own email. Rather you are making a transfer or donation of records to the Archives that we will preserve and manage for the use of future researchers as a historical resource.

Email transferred to Archives is stored offline, outside any active email system. Once you delete it from your active account you not be able to access it through SFU Mail. Currently the Archives provides only offline access to historical email collections through software (ePADD) installed on a dedicated terminal in the Archives reading room.

**If you require continuing access to some or all of the email after transfer do not delete it from your active email account. Consult an archivist to determine what is most appropriate for your own circumstances.**
