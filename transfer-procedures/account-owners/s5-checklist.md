# Email Transfer Checklist: Account Owners

- [ ] 1. Consult with an archivist to see if your email may be transferred to Archives.
  - The archivist will advise on which parts of your email account are suitable for transfer.

- [ ] 2. Create a `Transfer folder` nested in your `Inbox`.

- [ ] 3. Move email folders and / or messages into the `Transfer folder`.
  - Wherever possible keep messages in their original folder structures.
  - There is no limit to the number of sub-folders or sub-levels you can nest within the `Transfer folder`

- [ ] 4. Add permissions on your `Inbox` for the Archives' `archeml` account:
  - `Permission level` = "None".
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)

- [ ] 5. Add permissions on your `Transfer folder` and every sub-folder within it for the Archives' `archeml` account.
  - `Permission level` = "Reviewer".
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)

- [ ] 6. Notify the Archives that your email is ready for transfer.

- [ ] 7. Receive from Archives a **Transfer Completed Notice** listing the transfer folders the Archives has copied and exported from SFU Mail.

- [ ] 8. Send Archives confirmation that the list of folders is complete, i.e. everything you intended to transfer has in fact been transferred.

- [ ] 9. Receive from Archives a **Transfer Accessioned Notice** giving your transfer a unique `Accession number` and listing the folders transferred.

- [ ] 10. Determine whether or not to delete or retain your own copies of the emails transferred.
  - **Once deleted you will not be able to access transferred email via your SFU Mail account**

- [ ] 11. If retaining any email that was transferred, segregate it from your other email folders and keep it clearly labelled.
  - This is to prevent you from inadvertently transferring the same email folders and messages at a later date.

- [ ] 12. If retaining any `Transfer folder(s)`, move them out of your `Inbox` and remove the permissions granted to Archives on them.
