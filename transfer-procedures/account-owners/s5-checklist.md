# 5. Email Transfer Checklist: Account Owners

Use this checklist when transferring email from SFU Mail accounts.

- [ ] 1. Consult with an archivist to see if your email may be transferred to Archives.
  - The archivist will advise on which parts of your email account are suitable for transfer and long-term preservation.

- [ ] 2. Create a `Transfer folder` inside your `Inbox`.
  - You can give the `Transfer folder` any name but it must be placed in the `Inbox`.

- [ ] 3. Move email folders and / or messages into the `Transfer folder`.
  - Wherever possible keep messages in their original folder structures.
  - There is no limit to the number of sub-folders or sub-levels you can nest within the `Transfer folder`

- [ ] 4. Add permissions on your `Inbox` for the Archives' `archeml` account:
  - `Permission level` = "None".
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)
  - For screenshots etc. see [section 2.2 Add permissions to the Inbox](./s2-sfu-accounts.md#22-add-permissions-to-the-inbox).

- [ ] 5. Add permissions on your `Transfer folder` and every sub-folder within it for the Archives' `archeml` account.
  - `Permission level` = "Reviewer" (= read-only access)
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)
  - **You must add these permissions to every folder you intend to transfer, not just the top-level `Transfer folder`**.
    - For screenshots etc. see [section 2.3 Add permissions to the transfer folder(s)](./s2-sfu-accounts.md#22-add-permissions-to-the-transfer-folders).

- [ ] 6. Notify the Archives that your email is ready for transfer.

- [ ] 7. Receive notice from the Archives that the transfer has been completed and review the accompanying `Transfer list` of folders that the Archives has copied and exported from SFU Mail.
  - Ensure that everything you intended to transfer was in fact successfully transferred (i.e. appears on the `Transfer list`).

- [ ] 8. If folders are missing from the `Transfer list`, double-check to make sure you added permissions to the missing folders and add them if required.

- [ ] 9. Confirm with the Archives that the `Transfer list` is complete or incomplete.
  - If folders were missed, the Archives will re-run the entire transfer; repeat steps 7-9 as needed.

- [ ] 10. Receive from Archives a **Transfer Accessioned Notice** giving your transfer a unique `Accession number` and listing the folders transferred.

- [ ] 11. Determine whether or not to delete or retain your own copies of the emails transferred.
  - **Once deleted you will not be able to access transferred email via your SFU Mail account**

- [ ] 12. If you are retaining any email that was transferred, separate it from your other email folders and keep it clearly labelled so that you will not inadvertently re-send the same email at a later date.

- [ ] 13. If you are retaining the `Transfer folder` or any of its sub-folders for re-use in future transfers, move them out of your `Inbox` and delete or change the permissions setting granted to Archives on them.
  - Changing `Permission level` to "None" and `Folder visible` to "No" (unchecked) on the top-level folder should make the contents of any sub-folders inaccessible to the Archives.
  - The most secure approach, however, is to simply delete the permissions given to `archeml` and recreate them later when you need to.
