# 5. Email Transfer Checklist: Account Owners

This checklist applies to the transfer of email from SFU Mail accounts.

- [ ] 1. Consult with an archivist to see if your email may be transferred to Archives.
  - The archivist will advise on which parts of your email account are suitable for transfer and long-term preservation.

- [ ] 2. Create a `Transfer folder` nested in your `Inbox`.
  - You can give the `Transfer folder` any name but it must be placed in your `Inbox`.

- [ ] 3. Move email folders and / or messages into the `Transfer folder`.
  - Wherever possible keep messages in their original folder structures.
  - There is no limit to the number of sub-folders or sub-levels you can nest within the `Transfer folder`

- [ ] 4. Add permissions on your `Inbox` for the Archives' `archeml` account:
  - `Permission level` = "None".
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)

- [ ] 5. Add permissions on your `Transfer folder` and every sub-folder within it for the Archives' `archeml` account.
  - `Permission level` = "Reviewer".
  - `Folder visible` = "Yes" (check box)
  - **You must add these permissions to every folder you intend to transfer, not just the top-level `Transfer folder`**.

- [ ] 6. Notify the Archives that your email is ready for transfer.

- [ ] 7. Receive notice from the Archives that the transfer has been completed and review the accompanying list of transfer folders the Archives has copied and exported from SFU Mail.

- [ ] 8. Send Archives confirmation that the list of folders is complete, i.e. everything you intended to transfer has in fact been transferred.

- [ ] 9. Receive from Archives a **Transfer Accessioned Notice** giving your transfer a unique `Accession number` and listing the folders transferred.

- [ ] 10. Determine whether or not to delete or retain your own copies of the emails transferred.
  - **Once deleted you will not be able to access transferred email via your SFU Mail account**

- [ ] 11. If you are retaining any email that was transferred, separate it from your other email folders and keep it clearly labelled so that you will not inadvertently re-send the same email folders and messages at a later date.

- [ ] 12. If you are retaining the `Transfer folder` or any of its sub-folder for future transfers, move them out of your `Inbox` and remove the permissions granted to Archives on them.
