## Introduction
These procedures are written for owners of email accounts who wish to transfer email to SFU Archives. The Archives’ transfer methods for email require that account owners perform certain actions on their end. This guide describes those actions.

Anyone considering transferring email to the Archives should make sure they understand the implications of transferring their email; please read [Section 1 – Before you start](./s1-before-you-start.md). [Section 2](./s2-sfu-accounts.md) gives procedures for SFU accounts, [Section 3](./s3-non-sfu-accounts.md) for non-SFU accounts. Those interested in what happens behind the scenes can find a brief description of the process in [Section 4](../s4-after-transfer.md) and (in more detail) in the Archives' general Guide to Email Archiving (in progress; will be available in this GitHub repository when completed).

Note that the email transfer process captures only email messages and attachments. The Archives does not currently acquire other data typically included in email platforms, e.g. calendars, address books, task lists.
