# 1. Before You Start
The Archives is selective in its acquisition of email. We are currently working on a more formal acquisition strategy which will set out selection criteria. In the meantime, consult with an archivist to determine whether or not your email can be retained for permanent archival preservation and if so, which parts of it.

In general:
* Email made or received in your capacity as an SFU employee engaged in university business are university records and may be transferred to the Archives under an applicable [Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority (RRSDA)](http://www.sfu.ca/archives2/dur/rrsdas.html).

* Email as personal correspondence may be transferred to the Archives under a [Donation Agreement](http://www.sfu.ca/archives/for-donors/donations.html).

An archivist will advise you on how to proceed. 

Please be aware of the implications of transferring your email to Archives. It is not intended as a personal service to provide you with ongoing access to your own email. Rather you are making a donation of materials to the Archives that we will preserve and manage for the use of future researchers as a historical resource.

Email transferred to Archives is stored outside any active email system. You will not be able to access it through those systems. Currently the Archives provides only offline access to historical email collections through software (ePADD) installed on a dedicated terminal in the Archives reading room.

**If you require continuing access to the email messages you are transferring do not delete them from your active email account following transfer. Consult an archivist to determine what is most appropriate for your own circumstances.**
