# Email transfer procedures for SFU archivists

###### Status: under development

These procedures are written for SFU Archives' staff who are processing email transfers.
- For the process from the creator's / donor's point of view, see [Email transfer procedures for account owners](../account-owners/00-introduction.md).

The present document assumes that an archivist has discussed transfer with the account owner (or their estate) and reached agreement regarding the parts of the account that will be transferred.

These procedures mainly apply to transfers of email from SFU accounts.
- **If you are transferring part of an account** (i.e. specific folders rather than the whole account itself), start at [section 1, Transfer folders from an SFU account](./01-transfer-folders.md).
- **If you are taking an entire account** (all its folders), start at [section 2, Transferring an entire SFU account](./02-transfer-account.md).

Typically you target specific folders when the account will still be **active** following transfer (e.g. the email creator is retiring but will continue to use the account). If the account is **inactive** (e.g. the email creator has passed away), you will typically acquire the entire account. But there may be circumstances where you do want to take an entire active account or just particular folders from an inactive one.

Email from non-SFU accounts must normally be delivered to Archives already in `maildir` or `mbox` format. You generally should follow the Archives' standard digital transfer procedures in these cases. But [section 3 (virus scan)](./03-virus-scan.md), [section 6 (accessioning)](./06-accession-transfer.md), [section 7 (Archivematica ingest)](./07-archivematica-ingest.md), and [section 8 (completion)](./08-complete-transfer.md) all contain email-specific detail that may still be relevant.

For a quick overview of email archiving process as a whole, including transfer, see the [Guide for email archives, section 3 â€“ Workflow](../../guide/03-workflow.md).
