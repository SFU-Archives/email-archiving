# Email Transfer Procedures: Account Owners

These procedures are written for owners of email accounts who wish to transfer email to SFU Archives. The Archivesâ€™ transfer methods for email require that account owners perform certain actions on their end. This guide describes those actions. 

Sections and sub-sections have been numbered to facilitate reference. Paragraphs are numbered only when they provide an instruction for a specific action or step, again for ease of reference.

Anyone considering transferring email to the Archives should first read section 1 (Before you start). Section 2 gives procedures for SFU accounts, section 3 for non-SFU accounts. Those interested in what happens behind the scenes can find a brief description of the process in section 4. For more information, see the Archives' general Guide to Email Archiving (in progress; will be available in this GitHub repository when completed).
