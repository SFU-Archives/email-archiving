## Introduction
These procedures are written for owners of email accounts who wish to transfer email to SFU Archives. The Archives’ transfer methods for email require that account owners perform certain actions on their end. These procedures describes those actions. 

Anyone considering transferring email to the Archives should first read [Section 1 – Before you start](../s1-before-you-start.md). [Section 2](../s2-sfu-accounts.md) gives procedures for SFU accounts, [section 3](../s3-non-sfu-accounts.md) for non-SFU accounts. Those interested in what happens behind the scenes can find a brief description of the process in [section 4](../s4-after-transfer.md]. For more information, see the Archives' general Guide to Email Archiving (in progress; will be available in this GitHub repository when completed).
