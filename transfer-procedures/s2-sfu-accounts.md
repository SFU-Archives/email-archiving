# 2. SFU Email Accounts

## 2.1 Set up a transfer folder

A. Create a transfer folder in your Inbox.
* The Archives works on Mac computers and Outlook for Mac requires shared folders to be nested under the owner's Inbox.

B. Move all messages or folders you wish to transfer into the transfer folder.
* You can name the transfer folder however you wish.

* You can move individual messages or folders containing messages into the transfer folder.

* You can add as many folders-within-folders as you wish, but be aware that you will need to add permissions (step 3.2) to every individual folder.

* In general you should try to maintain messages in their original folder structure as you used them; this provides valuable context for future researchers that will help them understand your email archive.

## 2.2 Add permissions

You need to add permissions to every folder (including the Inbox) to share them with Archives.
* Permissions should be given to the `archeml` account – this is an account used by Archives uniquely for email transfer.

* The permissions needed on the `Inbox` folder are different (more limited) than those for the other folders.

* The instructions below show how to add permissions; see also IT Services' help page on sharing folders in Outlook.

### Inbox

Right-click the `Inbox` folder and from the popup menu select "Permissions…"
* A new dialog box appears, "Permissions for the Inbox folder"; click the `+` button to add a new permission.

* A new dialog box appears prompting you to add the email address of the person you wish to share the folder with; enter "archeml" and click the Search Directory button.

* The name "Archives Digital Repository – archives_repository@sfu.ca" should appear; click the `Add` button.

* The Archives will now appear in the list of permissions. Make sure it is selected and highlighted. 

* Check the box "Folder visible" and leave the "Permission level" drop-down selection at "None." 

* Click the OK button to complete.
