# Transfer Procedures for Gmail Accounts
The Archives can accept non-SFU email in certain circumstances under the terms of a Donation Agreement. But non-SFU email must be transferred in `mbox` format or in a format that we can convert into `mbox` (see [Formats](../overview/formats.md)). **Gmail** can be readily exported by users themselves in `mbox` form.

## Export Gmail as mbox

Use Google's "takeout service" to export and download your Gmail as `mbox` files.

1. Navigate to your Google account page and log in (https://myaccount.google.com).

2. Click the `Data and personalization` link on the sidebar.

3. Scroll down the page and click the `Download your data` link.

4. On the `Google Takeout` page, scroll down to the `Mail` section.

5. Click `All Mail data included` button.

6. In the `Mail contents options` menu, deselect `All Mail` and select the individual mailbox folders you want to export and transfer (even if you select every folder).

The last step (deselect `All Mail`) is critical because it ensures that the original folder structure is preserved, i.e. Google will export each folder as its own `mbox` file rather than simply creating one big `mbox` file for everything.

Typically it will take some time for Google to prepare your email for download. When it is ready, Google will email your Gmail account with a link to download the `mbox` files.

## Transfer mbox files to Archives
Once you have your Gmail in `mbox` form, contact the Archives to arrange transfer. Typically this will involve packaging the files using the Archives' [SFU MoveIt packager](http://www.sfu.ca/archives/digital-repository/transfer-digital-records.html), then uploading the resulting `transfer package` to a designated `deposit folder` on SFU Vault or copying it to an external or USB drive for delivery to the Archives.

For more information about the Archives' standard digital transfer procedures, see the [Transfer Digital Records page on the Archives' website](https://www.sfu.ca/archives/digital-preservation/transfer-digital-records.html).
