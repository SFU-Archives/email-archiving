## Initiate request to transfer
[Workflow Diagram, steps A1-A5](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

Contact the Archives if you wish to transfer email.
- An archivist will consult with you to determine if your email is suitable for long-term preservation.
- The Archives does not acquire all SFU email; see the page on [Appraisal](/appraisal/overview.md) for more information.

## Determine scope of transfer
[Workflow Diagram, step A6](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

An archivist will work with you to determine the scope of the transfer.
- Under exceptional circumstances, the Archives may acquire an entire account, but this typically only happens with inactive accounts (e.g. a faculty member's estate wants to donate their personal archives, including email correspondence).
- The archivist will advise what types of email has long-term value and should be transferred.
- The archivist will also advise on whether you should retain or delete the email after transfer is complete.

## Create a Transfer Folder
[Workflow Diagram, step A7](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

Create a `Transfer Folder` in your `Inbox` to gather all folders and messages you will transfer.
- Give it a descriptive name, e.g. `ArchivesTransfer_July2022`.
- You can move entire folders or individual messages.
- You can add as many folders-within-folders as you wish.

**In general you should try to maintain messages in their original folder structure as you used them; this provides valuable context for future researchers that will help them understand your email archive.**

## Notify Archives Transfer Folder ready
[Workflow Diagram, step A8](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

Contact the Archives when your `Transfer Folder` has been finalized.
- Give us the exact name of the folder.
- Do not delete the email from your active account until the Archives sends you [notice that the transfer has been completed](#receive-notice-that-transfer-is-completed).

## Provide consent
[Workflow Diagram, step A12](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

The Archives will send a request to SFU IT Services to make a copy of your `Transfer Folder` to an Archives' email account dedicated to email transfers.

You will be cc'd on the transfer request.

**Reply to both ITS and Archives to signal your consent to the transfer of your email.**
- In the body of the message, simply say "I consent to the transfer of my email."
- Include your email signature if you use one.

## Respond to requests for additional information
[Workflow Diagram, step D2](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

An archivist will review your transferred email in order to conduct some high-level appraisal.
- We may not retain all folders; see the page on [Folder-Level Appraisal](/appraisal/folder-level-appraisal.md) for more information.
- The archivist may contact you to request more information about your email practices in order to better understand the context and content of particular folders.

## Receive notice that transfer is completed
[Workflow Diagram, step F3](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

An archivist will contact you when the transfer is complete.
- This means that we have confirmed that the data transferred successfully, have appraised / selected at the folder level, have exported the messages and attached out of SFU Mail and ingest the records into our digital preservation system.

## Delete or separate transferred email
[Workflow Diagram, step F4](../images/transfer-workflow.png)

If you no longer need to access the email messages transferred, you can now delete them from your account.
- **Once deleted, you will not be able to view transferred email from your SFU account.**
- The Archives' access protocols are set up for third parties to access historical email collections in an offline environment.
- If you need continuing access to particular messages, do not delete them from your account.

If you do retain some or all of the transferred messages, move them to a folder in your account clearly separated from your other email and marked as already transferred (e.g. a folder named `Transferred to Archives`, with sub-folders for each transfer).
- This ensures that you do not inadvertently re-transfer the same email later on.

Contact the Archives if you are uncertain whether you should retain or delete transferred email.
