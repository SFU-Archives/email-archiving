## What email can be transferred?
SFU Archives is selective in its acquisition of email: not all email can or should be permanently preserved. Consult with an archivist to determine whether or not your email is suitable for long-term preservation and if so, which parts of it.

In general:
- Emails made or received in your capacity as an SFU employee engaged in university business are university records and may be transferred to the Archives under an applicable [Records Retention Schedule and Disposal Authority (RRSDA)](http://www.sfu.ca/archives2/dur/rrsdas.html).

- Emails made or received as personal correspondence may be transferred to the Archives under a [Donation Agreement](http://www.sfu.ca/archives/for-donors/donations.html).

- Faculty members' emails relating to research or teaching materials are personal correspondence.

An archivist will advise you on how to proceed. Note that the transfer process currently captures only email messages and attachments; it **does not** capture other records typically included in email platforms, e.g. calendars, address books, task lists.

## Implications of transfer
Please be aware of the implications of transferring your email to Archives. It is not a service to provide you with ongoing access to your own email. Rather you are making a transfer or donation of records to the Archives that we will preserve and manage for the use of future SFU administrators and researchers as an historical resource.

Email transferred to Archives is stored offline, outside any active email system. Once you delete it from your active account you not be able to access it through SFU Mail. Currently the Archives provides only offline access to historical email collections through software (ePADD) installed on a dedicated terminal in the Archives reading room.

**If you require continuing access to some or all of the email after transfer do not delete it from your active email account. Consult an archivist to determine what is most appropriate for your own circumstances.**

## Transfer procedures
Transfer procedures are different depending on whether you are transferring SFU or non-SFU email. At present, the only non-SFU email the Archives has acquired is Gmail.
