# Appraisal: Overview
There are different opportunities for appraisal at different levels and at different phases in the workflow.

[Account-level appraisal (pre-transfer)](account-level-appraisal.md):
- Which email accounts should be acquired?

[Folder-level appraisal during transfer](folder-level-appraisal.md):
- Which folders in a selected account should be retained?
- Can be done during the transfer process or later with ePADD during archival processing.

[Message-level appraisal during processing](message-level-appraisal.md):
- Which messages in a selected account should be retained?
- The Archives tries to keep this minimal, done during archival processing with ePADD.
