# Folder-Level Appraisal
**Folder-level appraisal** may be feasible if the producer organized their email with a clear folder structure and was consistent in filing messages. The archivist can determine this by several means:
- Generate and review a tree-view of the directory structure (most easily done from a set of `mbox` files).
- Meet with the producer to review folders and discuss their email management practices.
- Review and sample individual folders.

Folder-level appraisal can be conducted in SFU Mail after ITS has copied the `Transfer Folder` to the Archives' transfer account and before the final export / conversion to `mbox`. It can also be done later in ePADD, as ePADD preserves the original folder structure in its appraisal and processing modules.

## Selection criteria
The goal is to select at the folder level for substantive email. The criteria will be different depending on whether the producer is transferring email in their capacity as an officer or employee of an organization (e.g. SFU administrator's business correspondence) or in their private capacity as a individual (e.g. faculty member's personal correspondence).

If the email consists of SFU business correspondence, folders should be mapped to existing records retention schedules.

**Retain** folders whose content:
- Reflects functions and activities unique to producer's role.
- Documents major decisions and actions for which the producer or their office was responsible.
- Documents the evolution of the organization's policy and procedures.
- Provides background / further context for understanding those decisions, actions, policies.

 **Do not retain** folders where:
- An applicable RRSDA provides for destruction.
-	The email was sent to the producer for information purposes only.
- The producer's office was not the **Office of Primary Responsibility** for the matter at hand (e.g. relating to finances, facilities, human resources).

## Semi-active
For SFU business correspondence, some email may not have long-term archival value, but must still be retained (according to retention schedules) for a semi-active period.

Semi-active email folders should be documented in an **Appraisal report**, along with the year in they can be destroyed.
- Semi-active folders scheduled for destruction should converted to `mbox` but separated from the archival folders and ingested to Archivematica separately ("semi-active AIP").
- Semi-active AIPs can be manually deleted through the Archivematica **Storage Service** when they are due for disposal.
