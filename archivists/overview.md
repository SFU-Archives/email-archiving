# Transfer Workflow for Archivists
The following pages provide guidance for SFU Archives' staff who process email transfers. It follows the phases set out in the [Workflow Diagram](/images/transfer-workflow.png) and provides additional detail for the various steps.

The workflow mainly focuses on transfers of email from SFU accounts.

For **non-SFU accounts**, email must be delivered to Archives in `mbox` format or in other formats that can be readily converted to `mbox` (see the discussion in [Formats](overview/formats.md) for more information). It can be transferred following the Archives' standard digital transfer procedures. Some content here, however will still be relevant to non-SFU email:
- Conversion to mbox.
- Virus-scan.
- Ingest to Archivematica.
- Completion of transfer.
