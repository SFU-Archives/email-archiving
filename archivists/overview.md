# Transfer Workflow for Archivists
The following pages provide guidance for SFU Archives' staff who process email transfers. It follows the phases set out in the [Workflow Diagram](/images/transfer-workflow.png) and provides additional detail for the various steps.

The workflow is mainly focussed on transfers of email from SFU accounts.

Email from **non-SFU accounts** must be delivered to Archives in `mbox` format or in other formats that can be converted to `mbox` (see the discussion in [Formats](overview/formats.md).
- Follow the Archives' standard digital transfer procedures in these cases.
- The pages here relating to conversion to mbox, virus-scanning, ingest to Archivematica, and completion of transfer all contain email-specific detail that may still be relevant.
