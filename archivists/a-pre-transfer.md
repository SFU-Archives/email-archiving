# A. Pre-Transfer
**Pre-transfer** is the first phase of the transfer process during which an archivist consults with an account-holder (`producer`) in order to determine whether or not to accept a transfer of email. If yes, the archivist creates an `Accession record` and creates a service request ticket with SFU IT Services to copy the email to a dedicated Archives' transfer account.

## Initiate transfer

SFU Archives does not at present have a formal email acquisition strategy. To date (Jul 2022), the Archives has acquired email from nine accounts. Most of these transfers were initiated in ad hoc fashion, at the request of the producer or their estate, or at the Archives' request when we became aware of the retirement or passing away of a senior administrator.

However initiated, at this stage an archivist consults with the account holder, their estate, or other senior administrators to determine the suitability of the email for long-term preservation.

## Accept or reject transfer

The archivist decides to accept or reject the proposed transfer. For selection criteria, see the discussion at [Account-Level Appraisal](appraisal/account-level-appraisal.md).
- If a transfer is rejected, the archivist should communicate this decision in writing to the producer and document the rationale in an appraisal report.

- **If you are transferring part of an account** (i.e. specific folders rather than the whole account itself), start at [section 1, Transfer folders from an SFU account](./01-transfer-folders.md).

- **If you are taking the whole account** (i.e. all its folders), start at [section 2, Transfer an entire SFU account](./02-transfer-account.md).

- Typically the Archives targets specific folders when the account will continue to be **active** following transfer (e.g. the email creator is retiring but will continue to use the account).

- Typically the Archives acquires an account if it is **inactive** (e.g. the email creator has passed away).

- But there may be circumstances where you do want to take an entire active account or just particular folders from an inactive one.
