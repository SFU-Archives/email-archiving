# Email Archiving

This repository contains documentation relating to SFU Archives' processes for email archiving. It is a work in progress, and currently only the section on [transfer procedures for account owners](./transfer-procedures/account-owners/account-owners.md) is complete. The other pages are placeholders for content still in development.

When complete, the repository will contain two parts:

[Transfer procedures](./transfer-procedures/transfer-home.md) provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for transferring email; there are separate guides for [account owners](./transfer-procedures/account-owners/account-owners.md) and [SFU archivists](./transfer-procedures/archives/archivist-home.md) respectively. Each contains a checklist that offers a quick overview of the process.

The [Guide for Email Archives](./guide-email-archiving/gde-home.md) provides a broader discussion of SFU Archives' approach, with separate sections covering software, formats, workflow, acquisition, transfer methods, appraisal and selection, arrangement and description, preservation, and access. This document is mainly intended for SFU Archives staff to provide guidance on the various actions required.
