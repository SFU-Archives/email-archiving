# Email Archiving

This site contains documentation relating to SFU Archives' processes for email archiving. It is a work in progress, and some pages here are placeholders for content still in development (marked in the [Contents section](#contents) as "forthcoming").

When complete, the site will contain two parts:

[Transfer procedures](./transfer-procedures/transfer-home.md) provide detailed, step-by-step instructions for transferring email; there are separate guides for [account owners](./transfer-procedures/account-owners/00-introduction.md) and [SFU archivists](./transfer-procedures/archives/00-introduction.md) respectively. Each contains a checklist that offers a quick overview of the process.

The [Guide for Email Archives](./guide/00-introduction.md) offers a broader discussion of SFU Archives' approach, covering the management lifecycle from acquisition to preservation and access.
