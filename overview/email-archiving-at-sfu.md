# Email Archiving at SFU

SFU Archives began testing email transfer in 2012. Over the next several years, the Archives acquired email from a number of SFU accounts. Following agreement with the account holder or their estate, the university's IT Services department (ITS) made backups of the accounts and stored them offline. In April 2018, ITS transferred the backups to Archives by restoring their contents to a dedicated Archives' account. Archives then exported and converted the email to `mbox` format and ingested the files into the Archives' preservation system (Archivematica) as unprocessed backlog.

In 2019-20, the Archives undertook an arrangement and description project with one of these email accounts (Michael Fellman, fonds F-260). The project established a basic workflow to integrate a number of different software tools for processing and managing email archives. In 2021 we were able to acquire email from an additional SFU account, and this provided an opportunity to review / revise transfer procedures. Transfer procedures have now been updated (May 2022) for both the account holder and archivist points of view.

Acquisition thus far has been ad hoc, as opportunity presented, typically at the end of an account holder's SFU career. Some email was transferred by SFU administrators upon retirement or leaving the university; others by the account owner's estate as part of a larger donation of a deceased faculty member's personal archives. To date we have received one transfer of non-SFU email, originating from an organization's various gmail accounts.

The Archives' longer-term goal is to develop a more comprehensive and proactive acquisition strategy. The aim will be to achieve wider coverage â€“ more accounts captured and more frequent transfers of records from them. One-time, end-of-career transfers are better than nothing, but we need processes to support on-going, regular transfers of university email business records, as well as privately donated personal and business correspondence.

The Archives now has eight email accounts in backlog. We plan to begin processing these in 2022-23 and, as part of this work, to document our appraisal, arrangement and description, and access processes.
