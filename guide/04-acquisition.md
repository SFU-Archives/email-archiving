# 4. Acquisition
SFU Archives is able to acquire entire email accounts or targeted folders within them. But we currently lack an overall, coherent email acquisition strategy.

## Acquisition strategy
Acquisition thus far has been on an ad hoc basis, as opportunity presented, typically at the end of an account holder's SFU career. Some email was transferred by SFU administrators upon retirement; others by the account owner's estate as part of a larger donation of a deceased faculty member's personal archives. To date, the Archives has not acquired any non-SFU email.

The Archives' longer-term goal is to develop a more comprehensive and proactive acquisition strategy. The aim will be to achieve wider coverage â€“ more accounts captured and more frequent transfers of records from them. One-time, end-of-career transfers are better than nothing, but we need processes to support on-going, regular transfers of university email business records, as well as privately donated personal and business correspondence.

## Acquisitions

As of July 2020, the Archives has acquired email from **six** SFU email accounts. One account (Fellman) has been processed, but the description remains in draft form, not yet finalized.
